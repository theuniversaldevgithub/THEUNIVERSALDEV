  <h1 id="cpa">CHARLIE PUTH</h1>
  <p id="cpa1">Charles Otto Puth Jr. (born December 2, 1991) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. His
    initial exposure came through the viral success of his song videos uploaded to YouTube.</p>
  <div id="cpd">
    <h1 style="text-align: center;">VOICENOTES</h1>
    <p>
      Over the past three years, Charlie Puth has proven himself commercially with the extraordinary success of four
      multi-platinum hits, "One Call Away," "Marvin Gaye," and "We Don’t Talk Anymore" from his platinum-selling, Top 10
      debut album Nine Track Mind, as well as his breakout hit "See You Again" — the best-selling song of 2015 worldwide
      that spent 12 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, earned him three Grammy nominations (including Song of the Year),
      a Golden Globe nomination, and 9x-platinum certification in the U.S. But the New Jersey-born singer, songwriter,
      musician, and producer was also eager to prove himself artistically when it came time to make his second album,
      Voicenotes, named after the trusty iPhone app he uses to collect his musical ideas. Puth co-wrote every song and
      recorded and produced the album entirely himself (barring one song he co-produced with Max Martin) mainly at his
      home studio in Los Angeles.
      <br>
      A meticulously crafted game-changer replete with sparkling melodies and sleek, danceable grooves, Voicenotes
      decimates everything people may think they know about this musical polymath, who has not only written and produced
      his own massive hits, but also for other artists spanning a range of genres, including Jason Derulo, Trey Songz,
      Thomas Rhett, Maroon 5, and G-Eazy. On Voicenotes, Puth allows himself to truly be seen, not only as an artist but
      also as a human, which meant stepping out from behind the detached façade of lovelorn balladeering and being
      transparent about his emotions and influences.
      <br>
      On the lyrical front, Voicenotes is an album that is largely about Puth’s struggle to find a normal relationship
      when his own life has hardly been normal since finding multiplatinum success, and the anxiety that pursuit has
      induced. "I wanted it to be a story of my travels from the East Coast to the West Coast and how my growing fame
      has affected my mind in good and bad ways," he says. The first three singles — "Attention," "How Long," and "Done
      For Me" featuring Kehlani — cover that territory. "Whenever I met anybody, they often knew more about me than I
      knew about myself," he says. "I’d never dealt with anything like that before." Songs like "LA Girls," "Like A
      Boy," and "Slow It Down" detail different aspects of the rarified life of someone who feels like he should be
      enjoying the glittering lifestyle of fabulous parties and ample romantic opportunities, but just doesn’t —
      something Puth addresses on self-acceptance anthem "The Way I Am," which opens with the following lines: "Maybe
      I’m a get a little anxious / Maybe I’m a get a little shy / Cuz everybody’s trying to be famous / And I’m just
      trying to find a place to hide").
      <br>
      "I thought I was supposed to go to all these parties and be this type of person so I’ve always shoved my anxiety
      under the carpet because I didn’t think anyone cared to hear about it," he says. “This album touches on that, but
      I also wanted to make sure that these songs, at the end of the day, are fun because some people choose not to
      listen to the lyrics. They just want to go to the club, listen to the beat, and have a great time. And that’s
      totally fine, too."
      <br>
      To achieve his goal of making people want to “dance and cry at the same time,” Puth allowed his love for jazz and
      late ’80s/early ’90s R&B to shine through, which upped the music’s sophistication level several notches.
      Voicenotes’ up-tempo, groove-minded songs like “Attention," “How Long," “Done For Me," and "The Way I Am" are so
      effortlessly catchy that they seem simple on the surface, but are hardly that. Puth, whose perfect pitch means he
      is often distracted by identifying the notes sounded by passing car horns and leaf-blowers, began studying jazz at
      age 10 and attended both the Manhattan School of Music Pre-College, where he majored in jazz piano, and Berklee
      College of Music, where he graduated with a degree in music production and engineering. His classical training is
      on full display, along with his impeccable influences — which range from jazz greats Miles Davis, John Coltrane,
      and Bill Evans to R&B songwriter-producers Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Teddy Riley.
      <br>
      "I was influenced by artists who were proving something when they broke off from their groups," Puth says, citing
      Bobby Brown and Ralph Tresvant after New Edition, Steve Perry after Journey, and George Michael after Wham!. "When
      George left Wham! he wanted to show the world that he could produce records like ‘Careless Whisper’ and ‘Father
      Figure’ on his own," Puth says. "He didn’t do it in vengeful way. He was just showing people how musical he was.
      That was really my goal as well." Puth’s musical heroes turn up on two of Voicenotes’ tracks, "If You Leave Me
      Now," featuring Boys II Men ("What they sent me was perfect; it was the first time I didn’t have to do anything to
      finish a song") and "Change," featuring his idol James Taylor ("I never thought I’d be able to do a song with him
      and when I met him, it confirmed in my mind that I want to have a career just like his").
      <br>
      Audiences have embraced Puth’s bold new direction. "Attention,” which the New York Times pop critic Jon Caramanica
      listed fourth on his year-end list of "Best Songs of 2017," climbed to No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 (Puth’s
      highest-charting single as a solo artist), hit No. 1 on both the Top 40 and Hot AC radio charts, and his been
      certified double-platinum, while the funky, cheating-ex song "How Long" hit No. 3 at Top 40 radio and has been
      certified platinum.
      <br>
      For all of his success, Puth still sees himself as the kid from Rumson who played organ in church and made
      mixtapes for the girls at school. "I still have the same deep infatuation with chord changes, girls, and food,” he
      says. "Nothing’s really changed. I still find myself to be a pretty humble guy. Every room I walk into I think I’m
      the worst songwriter and I have to prove myself. But it’s because of that that I get better.”
